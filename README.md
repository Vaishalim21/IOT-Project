# IOT-Project
IOT Based Smart home.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an important technology affecting the Internet and communication technologies. The Internet of Things enables people and things to connect and work anytime, anywhere and in any way/design. Home automation systems have been around for decades, but remain a niche product for high-end consumers due to project costs and budgets. When it comes to home automation systems, security is one of the most important factors in not implementing a home automation system. A clumsy attitude combined with a routine can sometimes make us so rushed that we forget to turn off the lights. This will increase electricity costs.


This project presents the development and implementation of a new model home automation system that uses WIFI technology as network infrastructure to connect multiple places. The main goal of this project is to develop a home automation system that can be controlled from an Android phone using an ESP8266 connected to WIFI.

 
Modern homes are increasingly moving from traditional switches to centralized systems that include remote switches. Currently, traditional wall switches are located in many places in the home, making it difficult for users to operate near the switch. It was even more difficult to manage elderly and disabled people. To do this, on the receiver side, connect the WIFI module to NODEMCU ESP8266, and the Android app on the phone on the transmitter side, send on/off commands to the receiver connected to the load. The equipment used in this project is an ESP8266, Arduino, Relay board, Servo motor, DHT11 Humidity, Soil Moisture, Smoke Detector and Water level Sensor.


The control system's main unit, WIFI technology, allows remote access from a phone. Switch status   is synchronized across the   control system, and each user interface reports the status of existing switches in real time. The system is designed to control home appliances and devices with an accessible design, user-friendly interface and easy installation. The developed system can be integrated as a single portable unit and allows one to wirelessly control lights, fans, air conditioners, television sets, electronic doors and turn ON or
